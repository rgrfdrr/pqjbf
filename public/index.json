Noise maps are an urban planning tool that, over the last two decades, has made it easier for citizens to obtain detailed information on noise levels and the degree of noise pollution in different areas of cities.\nHowever, despite the above, the public administration is far from being fully transparent in this regard. The difficulty in locating these noise maps on the websites of individual municipalities and the limited publicity given to strategic noise maps prior to their approval—despite the fact that the public information process is a requirement established by law—mean that citizens are often unaware of the existence of this tool. Even if they do know about it, they are forced to face difficulties that prevent them from obtaining the information they seek or that directly lead them to give up.\nIn this regard, it is essential to continue moving toward a greater degree of transparency in the dissemination of noise maps, in order to guarantee citizens easy access to accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information on the true noise situation in their surroundings.\n","date":"April 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/art/ruido/","section":"articles","summary":"","title":"Mapas de ruido, urbanismo y transparencia","type":"art"},{"content":"Here you can read my articles\n","date":"April 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/art/","section":"articles","summary":"","title":"articles","type":"art"},{"content":"\rteacher, lawyer\r// → Created: aijsh\n// → You can read my articles\n// → I like: music, music, music\n","date":"April 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Paulus:","summary":"","title":"Paulus:","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
